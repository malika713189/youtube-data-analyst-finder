SQL CTEs, or Common Table Expressions, are a helpful feature in SQL. They can help you clean up a query and make it easier to read, and are available in many vendors including Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, and Postgres.

In this video, you’ll learn what a CTE is, why you would want to use one, see an example of transforming a query to use a CTE, and see the benefits of a CTE.

QNfnuK-1YYY,SQL WITH Clause | How to write SQL Queries using WITH Clause | SQL CTE (Common Table Expression),"SQL WITH Clause | How to write SQL Queries using WITH Clause | SQL CTE (Common Table Expression)
In this video, we shall understand how to write SQL Queries using WITH Clause. We will go through the syntax of using WITH Clause and I will also explain how SQL treats and executes SQL Queries containing With Clause.
SQL WITH Clause is also referred to as CTE which stands for Common Table Expression and can also be referred to as Subquery Refactoring.

This video will also provide what are the advantages of using With Clause while writing SQL Queries and also mention few scenarios when you should be using With Clause while writing SQL Queries.

Download all the scripts and SQL Queries used in this video from my blog. Link below:

00:34 Query 1: Simple example of writing SQL Query using With clause
06:25 Query 2: Ideal Scenario for writing SQL Query using With clause
20:29 Advantages of using WITH Clause in SQL
22:19 When to use With Clause in SQL

If you are new to SQL then you might have assumed that SQL Queries must always start with SELECT clause but that's not true because we can also start SQL Queries using WITH Clause. Understanding With clause can really help you to solve some of the tricky problems in SQL.

In this video, we shall first see a simple example of using with clause within SQL query. The query no 2 explained in this video will be most suitable scenario for using WITH clause in SQL Query.

This tutorial is based on the CTE in SQL concept. CTE in SQL stands for Common Table Experssions. The CTE in SQL begins with the WITHkeyword in SQL. the CTE in SQL acts as an intermediate or temp table in SQL that stores the intermediate results of a sub query helping to minimise the code length and query execution time.

00:00 Introduction to CTE in SQL
01:59 What is CTE in SQL
05:45 Example of CTE in SQL

What does with CTE do in SQL?
A Common Table Expression (CTE) in SQL is a temporary result set that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. CTEs are defined using the WITH keyword and allow you to create a named, reusable subquery within your SQL statement.

Is CTE better than subquery?
When choosing between CTEs and subqueries, consider the specific use case. For one-off calculations or when dealing with small data sets, subqueries may be preferable. For repeated references to an intermediate result or when readability is a priority, CTEs might be the better choice.

CTE in SQL | Common Table Expression | SQL WITH Clause | CTE Query Performance | Advanced SQL

In this video you will learn about CTE (Common table expressions) In SQL. The WITH clause really simplifies the complicated queries, and makes the SQL queries readable.

with Inner query we can see the code getting messy and there is a lot of redundancy.

Also we have talked about the performance of queries using CTE. 
We even saw how CTE can degrade the performance.

CTE is very important from SQL Interview perspective, I hope this video should have given you a good idea on how to work with Common table expression in SQL.

Take the full course at https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/hierarchical-and-recursive-queries-in-sql-server at your own pace. More than a video, you'll learn hands-on coding & quickly apply skills to your daily work.

---
Welcome to the course hierarchical and recursive queries in SQL server. Before we start with this video, I want to give you a short outline of the course and what you can expect of it.

Have you ever thought about what is recursion and how to use it?
How you could query tables recursively with Common Expression tables or how you could simplify querying hierarchical data structures to minimize writing queries? After this course, you will be able to answer these, and many more questions. You will test your knowledge applying it to Real-World examples such as querying company organizations, assemble a car or planning flight plans.

In this lesson, we concentrate on common table expressions (CTEs) needed to create recursive queries. You will learn how to define them and how to use them.

So what is a CTE? 
A CTE specifies a temporary named result set. This is derived from a simple query and defined within the execution scope of a single statement. In general, a CTE is specified with a WITH statement and the name for the temporary result set. In this example, the CTE is defined by the name CTEtable. Within the CTE a query of a table could be executed. The CTE returns always a result set, and can be followed by a SELECT statement. In our example, we select the entire result set.

We can use CTEs in the following ways. Firstly, a CTE can be used to manage complicated queries. A CTE can be referenced with the SELECT, the INSERT, the UPDATE, and the DELETE statement and within one WITH statement several CTEs can be defined. These newly defined CTEs can then be combined with a UNION or JOIN. Moreover, a CTE can substitute a view, if, for example, a user doesn't have sufficient rights, a CTE can be used to self-reference a table and finally, a CTE can be used for recursion.

To see the application of CTEs on a real example, we want to use the CTE to query a table of an IT-organization. In this example, we use a multiple CTEs definition in a single query. In this example, the first definition creates the CTE named JOBS with the result set ID, SurName and JobTitle, which contains employees in manager positions. It is possible to set the result set of a CTE by specifying the fields inside parentheses at the WITH as definition or just by querying them inside the CTE. Next, we are selecting the ID, the Name and Position of all employees having a position with Manager in the job title. Similar to creating a view, you could select a table and correspond the selected fields to the result set of the CTE. The selected table in the CTE could be used for selecting, filtering or aggregating data later on.

Next, we define a second CTE. This CTE is used to query the salary table to get all salaries above 10000. It is defined by the name SALARIES and has the result set ID and Salary. So, we have now defined the two CTEs, JOBS and SALARIES. The final task is now to combine these two CTEs.

We have create the Jobs CTE and the Salaries CTE. As you can see, we are using an inner join on the results of CTEs to get only matching records of both tables. The join is performed on the ID of the employees to get the names of the employee with their job title and salary. The result could look like this. We have 3 Managers. Paul Smith, IT Manager, Adam Peterson Sourcing Manager and Anna Nilson Portfolio Manager with salaries of 15,000, 12,500 and 10,500.

You have now seen how you can use CTEs. In the following exercise, you have time to practice!

Ww71knvhQ-s,"SQL Window Function | How to write SQL Query using RANK, DENSE RANK, LEAD/LAG | SQL Queries Tutorial","This video is about Window Functions in SQL which is also referred to as Analytic Function in some of the RDBMS. SQL Window Functions covered in this video are RANK, DENSE RANK, ROW NUMBER, LEAD, LAG. Also, we see how to use SQL Aggregate functions like MIN, MAX, SUM, COUNT, AVG as window function. 

This video is focused on teaching how to write SQL Queries using different window functions or analytic functions. We go through the syntax of using rank, dense_rank, row_number, lead, lag and max functions as window function.

Over clause is explained in detail in this video. Over clause is used in SQL when we need to use window function. Inside Over clause, we also use Partition By clause and also Order by clause.
Partition By clause is used to specify the column based on which different windows needs to be created.

The window function you learn in this video is applicable to any RDBMS since these functions are commonly used across most of the popular RDBMS such as Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server etc.

Window functions in SQL are a very helpful feature if you want to perform calculations on your data.

But they can be a little tricky to understand.

In this video, you’ll learn what a window function is, why you would use one, and see a couple of examples on an SQL database.

This functionality is available in Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, and Postgres.

In SQL Server we have different categories of window functions
Aggregate functions - AVG, SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX etc..
Ranking functions - RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER etc..
Analytic functions - LEAD, LAG, FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE etc...

OVER Clause defines the partitioning and ordering of a rows (i.e a window) for the above functions to operate on. Hence these functions are called window functions. The OVER clause accepts the following three arguments to define a window for these functions to operate on.
ORDER BY : Defines the logical order of the rows
PARTITION BY : Divides the query result set into partitions. The window function is applied to each partition separately.
ROWSor RANGE clause : Further limits the rows within the partition by specifying start and end points within the partition.

The default for ROWS or RANGE clause is
RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW

Let us understand the use of ROWS or RANGE clause with an example. 

Compute average salary and display it against every employee

We might think the following query would do the job. 
SELECT Name, Gender, Salary, 
    AVG(Salary) OVER(ORDER BY Salary) AS Average
FROM Employees

As you can see from the result, the above query does not produce the overall salary average. It produces the average of the current row and the rows preceeding the current row. This is because, the default value of ROWS or RANGE clause (RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) is applied.

To fix this, provide an explicit value for ROWS or RANGE clause as shown below. ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING tells the window function to operate on the set of rows starting from the first row in the partition to the last row in the partition.

SELECT Name, Gender, Salary, 
    AVG(Salary) OVER(ORDER BY Salary ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS Average
FROM Employees

The same result can also be achieved by using RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING

Well, what is the difference between ROWS and RANGE
We will discuss this in a later video

The following query can be used if you want to compute the average salary of 
1. The current row
2. One row PRECEDING the current row and 
3. One row FOLLOWING the current row

SELECT Name, Gender, Salary, 
    AVG(Salary) OVER(ORDER BY Salary ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS Average
FROM Employees

zAmJPdZu8Rg,"SQL Window Function | How to write SQL Query using Frame Clause, CUME_DIST | SQL Queries Tutorial","SQL Window Function. How to write SQL Query using Frame Clause, CUME_DIST. SQL Queries Tutorial.

This video is about Window Functions in SQL which is also referred to as Analytic Function in some of the RDBMS. SQL Window Functions covered in this video are FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE, NTH_VALUE, NTILE, CUME_DIST and PERCENT_RANK. Also we cover how to use FRAME Clause while writing SQL Queries using window function. We also look at alternate way of writing SQL Query using window function. 

We discuss in detail about the Frame clause and how RANGE is different from ROWS and how to use Unbounded Preceding and Unbounded Following while using certain window functions.

This is the second video where we talk about window functions in SQL. I have made another video covering other window functions such as RANK, DENSE RANK, LEAD, LAG and ROW NUMBER. Link to the previous video is mentioned below:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww71knvhQ-s&t=119s

This video is focused on teaching how to write SQL Queries using different window functions or analytic functions. We go through the syntax of using first value, last value, frame clause, nth value. ntile, cume dist and percent rank as window function in SQL query.

We look at how to use WINDOW clause while writing SQL query using window functions. We talk about the OVER clause and how partition by clause can impact the result set.

Over clause is explained in detail in this video. Over clause is used in SQL when we need to use window function. Inside Over clause, we also use Partition By clause and also Order by clause.
Partition By clause is used to specify the column based on which different windows needs to be created.

The window function you learn in this video is applicable to any RDBMS since these functions are commonly used across most of the popular RDBMS such as Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server etc.

Welcome to our YouTube tutorial on window functions in SQL!We'll start by understanding what window functions are and how they differ from regular SQL functions. Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row, providing insights without grouping the results. This allows for more complex analysis and better insights into your data.Next, we'll cover aggregate functions and their role in summarizing data. We'll see how the aggregate functions can be used within window functions to offer detailed analytics and how they can enhance our ability to analyze data.We'll then dive into the different types of window functions available. These include ranking functions like RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER(), aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), and MAX(), and analytic functions like LEAD(), LAG(), FIRST_VALUE(), and LAST_VALUE(). Then we will learn about syntax of window functions which will enable you to write effective and efficient window function queries.Finally, we'll see window functions in action. We'll demonstrate how to use them in practical scenarios, such as calculating moving averages, running totals, and ranking rows within partitions. By the end of this video, you'll have a solid understanding of window functions in SQL and how to leverage them for powerful data analysis.

H6OTMoXjNiM,SQL Tutorial - Window Functions,"Another fantastic SQL Tutorial brought to you by BeardedDev.

In this video we begin to explore Window Functions and their purpose within SQL Server.

If you would like to follow along, I have published another Window Functions tutorial that will allow you to do this, it can be found here: https://youtu.be/lBcDSsgp0RU

Window Functions are used for performing data analysis calculations and address an important need compared to the GROUP BY clause that we are able to return the underlying data in the same query.

This video shows an example of the differences between the GROUP BY clause and Window Functions.

Window Functions were first introduced in SQL Server 2005 but further enhancements and support was added in SQL Server 2012.

We look at the OVER clause and PARTITION BY.

Window Functions can only be included within SELECT or ORDER BY clauses.

Functions Available:
Aggregate - COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG
Offset - FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE, LEAD, LAG
Statistical - PERCENT_RANK, CUME_DIST, PERCENTILE_CONT, PERCENTILE_DIST

Windows Functions also have FRAMES
ROWS
RANGE

Window Functions are a powerful tool within SQL Server and I am excited to bring more videos and tutorials working with Window Functions in the future.

Code:

WITH CTE
AS
(
SELECT
 Sales_Id
 , SUM(Line_Total) AS Total
FROM Sales_Details
GROUP BY Sales_Id
)

SELECT * FROM CTE AS A

 ON A.Sales_Id = B.Sales_Id

SELECT

In this video we shall cover INNER Join, LEFT Join and RIGHT Join. I’ll be posting the second part of this video next week where we shall cover FULL OUTER Join, SELF Join, CROSS Join and NATURAL Join.

Before we talk about different types of Joins in SQL, we shall first understand what are JOINS and why do we need them and then finally write some SQL queries to understand how to use them. We shall practice writing SQL queries using inner, left and right joins in this video.

Joins are the most fundamental concepts in SQL and having a clear understanding of Joins is very essential to write good SQL queries.

Join 2 Tables And Copy Rows Into A New Table SQL Server database

To combine data from two tables in a SQL Server database and insert the resulting rows into a new table, you perform a SQL JOIN operation. This operation matches rows based on specified criteria from both tables and creates a unified dataset. Then, you use an INSERT INTO statement to copy the selected rows into a new table, effectively merging the data. This process is essential for consolidating and aggregating information from different sources or for various analytical tasks in SQL databases.

xUsY2jWQa1w,SQL JOINS Interview Question | What does different SQL Joins return?,"Given 2 tables, identify the no of records returned using different type of SQL Joins. This is a very frequently asked SQL Interview questions especially when a recruiter wants to test your knowledge on SQL joins, this is the kind of questions you can expect.

In this video, we shall look at 2 different datasets. Each dataset contains 2 tables which has duplicate data, null values etc. You are required to identify the no of records returned using INNER Join, LEFT Join, RIGHT Join, FULL JOIN, Natural  Join and Cross  Join. And you need to answer them without querying the tables. 

Hence in order to answer such questions, you need to understand clearly how SQL internally performs different type of joins.

RehbnzKHS28,SQL JOINS Tutorial for beginners | Practice SQL Queries using JOINS - Part 2,"This is the SQL JOINS Tutorial for complete beginners. This is the second part of the series. In this video we shall cover FULL OUTER Join, CROSS Join, NATURAL Join and SELF Join. In the first part of this video series, I had covered INNER Join, LEFT join and RIGHT Join.

I start this video by discussing about FULL OUTER Join. But in order to understand FULL OUTER Join, we need to first look at the difference in output from INNER, LEFT and RIGHT JOIN. So we go through the difference in these 3 joins first and then I explain the concept of FULL OUTER Join.
We then cover CROSS join and I explain a scenario where you may need to use CROSS join.
We then talk about NATURAL join. I'll tell you the difference between NATURAL join and INNER join and also tell you why you should not be using NATURAL Join.
Finally, we cover one of the most important JOINS in SQL which is the SELF JOIN. I explain SELF join by taking a real world example. 
Every concept is explained by writing SQL queries so hopefully this video along with the first part of this video, should help you to completely understand JOINS in SQL.

Joins are the most fundamental concepts in SQL and having a clear understanding of Joins is very essential to write good SQL queries.

The SQL GROUP BY keyword is a powerful feature that lets you summarise data from your query into groups.

This can be helpful to see the number of employees in a department, or the total value of sales per month, and much more. Any time you need ""something PER something else"", it's often done with an SQL Group By.

In this video, you'll learn what Group By is, a step-by-step process on how to write one, what happens if you don't include Group By, and some examples.

nNrgRVIzeHg,"Advanced Aggregate Functions in SQL (GROUP BY, HAVING vs. WHERE)","In this step-by-step video tutorial, you will learn some more advanced SQL aggregation concepts by using the GROUP BY, HAVING, and WHERE clauses!

Learn about the BASIC aggregation Functions: https://youtu.be/jcoJuc5e3RE

Queries:
1) Pull aggregate information with the GROUP BY clause: SELECT column1, column2, COUNT(column3) FROM table GROUP BY column1, column2
2) Use the HAVING clause to filter your aggregation: SELECT column1, COUNT(column2) FROM table GROUP BY column1 HAVING COUNT(column2) = 5
3) Use WHERE and HAVING clauses in the same query: SELECT column1, COUNT(column2) FROM table WHERE column1 = 3 GROUP BY column1 HAVING COUNT(column2) = 5

Create Table tblProducts
(
 [Id] int identity primary key,
 [Name] nvarchar(50),
 [Description] nvarchar(250)
)

Create Table tblProductSales
(
 Id int primary key identity,
 ProductId int foreign key references tblProducts(Id),
 UnitPrice int,
 QuantitySold int
)

Insert into tblProducts values ('TV', '52 inch black color LCD TV')
Insert into tblProducts values ('Laptop', 'Very thin black color acer laptop')
Insert into tblProducts values ('Desktop', 'HP high performance desktop')

Insert into tblProductSales values(3, 450, 5)
Insert into tblProductSales values(2, 250, 7)
Insert into tblProductSales values(3, 450, 4)
Insert into tblProductSales values(3, 450, 9)

Write a query to retrieve products that are not at all sold?
This can be very easily achieved using subquery as shown below. 

Select [Id], [Name], [Description]
from tblProducts
where Id not in (Select Distinct ProductId from tblProductSales)

Most of the times subqueries can be very easily replaced with joins. The above query is rewritten using joins and produces the same results. 
Select tblProducts.[Id], [Name], [Description]
from tblProducts
left join tblProductSales
on tblProducts.Id = tblProductSales.ProductId
where tblProductSales.ProductId IS NULL

In this example, we have seen how to use a subquery in the where clause.

Let us now discuss about using a sub query in the SELECT clause. Write a query to retrieve the NAME and TOTALQUANTITY sold, using a subquery.
Select [Name],
(Select SUM(QuantitySold) from tblProductSales where ProductId = tblProducts.Id) as TotalQuantity
from tblProducts
order by Name

Query with an equivalent join that produces the same result.
Select [Name], SUM(QuantitySold) as TotalQuantity
from tblProducts
left join tblProductSales
on tblProducts.Id = tblProductSales.ProductId
group by [Name]
order by Name

From these examples, it should be very clear that, a subquery is simply a select statement, that returns a single value and can be nested inside a SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE statement. 

It is also possible to nest a subquery inside another subquery.

According to MSDN, subqueries can be nested upto 32 levels.

Subqueries are always encolsed in paranthesis and are also called as inner queries, and the query containing the subquery is called as outer query.

The columns from a table that is present only inside a subquery, cannot be used in the SELECT list of the outer query.

Fala Impressionadores! Na aula de hoje eu vou te mostrar o que é uma subquery e como ela pode te auxiliar na criação de códigos mais otimizados!

Uma subquery é um recurso dentro do SQL que permite a criação de queries mais otimizadas no SQL.

Mas o que é uma query? Nada mais é do que uma consulta a um banco de dados, só que com a subquery nós podemos reaproveitar essas informações em outra query que precise!

Então vamos a aula que eu vou te mostrar o que são subqueries no SQL, onde usar subqueries e vou te mostrar um exemplo para que tudo fique mais fácil de ser entendido!

Lembrando que aqui estamos utilizando o Oracle SQL Developer, mas você pode utilizar qualquer outro SGBD para reproduzir o que vou te ensinar!

Check out free masterclass from industry-leading experts here: https://www.scaler.com/events?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=osocial&utm_campaign=brand_scaler_events_osocial_youtube_Advanced-SQL-Full-Tutorial-2023&utm_content=YTDescription

What is SQL?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is a standard language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. SQL allows users to create, modify, and query databases, as well as to extract and manipulate data within them.
SQL is used to perform a wide range of tasks, such as creating and modifying database schema, inserting, updating and deleting data, and querying the database to retrieve information. 

What are SQL Subqueries?
Subqueries in SQL are queries that are nested within another query. They allow for more complex queries by enabling a query to reference the results of another query as a temporary table. This can be useful for filtering, sorting, and aggregating data in more complex ways than a single query can achieve.

What is Advanced SQL?
Advanced SQL refers to the use of more complex SQL features and techniques to perform advanced data manipulation and analysis. This can include subqueries, joins, aggregations, and window functions. Advanced SQL can be used to perform complex data transformations and generate insights from large and complex datasets.

What are window functions?
Window functions in SQL are used to perform calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row. They allow for complex data analysis and aggregation without the need for subqueries or self-joins. Examples of window functions include ranking functions, aggregate functions, and analytic functions.

What is DBMS?
DBMS stands for Database Management System. It is software that allows users to create, manage, and access databases. DBMS provides a set of tools and functions for storing, organising, retrieving, and manipulating data in a structured and efficient manner. It helps to ensure data consistency, security, and integrity.

About SQL interviews-
These are job interviews where the candidate is evaluated on their knowledge of SQL, including their ability to write and optimise SQL queries, create and manipulate databases, and understand database design principles. These interviews are common in data-related roles such as data analyst, data engineer, and database administrator.

yS-f8T-6wZM,SQL Tutorial - Nesting CASE statements,"Learn how to nest CASE statements in this SQL tutorial, nesting CASE statements can be used for layers of conditional logic but can become complex and difficult to read so always remember to add comments to your code, I also like to indent my case statements to improve readability.  The other issue with nested CASE statements is that they are not very dynamic but we could overcome that problem by storing the values in a separate table then joining to that table.

To follow along with this SQL tutorial run the below code, also includes nested case statements created in the video, replace greater than and less than with actual symbols:

--- 
Great job so far! Let's take a look at CASE statements with aggregate functions.

CASE statements can be used to create columns for categorizing data, and to filter your data in the WHERE clause.

You can also use CASE statements to aggregate data based on the result of a logical test.

Let's say you wanted to prepare a summary table counting the number of home and away games that Liverpool won in each season.

If you've created summary tables in Spreadsheets, you can probably visualize the final table, here -- 
but how do you get a count of Liverpool's wins in each season?

You guessed it -- a CASE statement. CASE statements are like any other column in your query, so you can include them inside an aggregate function.

Take a look at the CASE statement. The WHEN clause includes a similar logical test to the previous lesson -- did Liverpool play as the home team, AND did the home team score higher than the away team? 

The difference begins in your THEN clause. Instead of returning a string of text, you return the column identifying the unique match id. When this CASE statement is inside the COUNT function, it COUNTS every id returned by this CASE statement.
 
You then add a second CASE statement for the away team, and group the query by the season. 

When counting information in a CASE statement, you can return anything you'd like -- a number, a string of text, or any column in the table, SQL is COUNTing the number of rows returned by the CASE statement.

Similarly, you can use the SUM function to calculate a total of any value. Let's say we're interested in the number of home and away goals that Liverpool scored in each season.

This is fairly simple to set up -- if the hometeam_id is Liverpool's, return the home_goal value. The ELSE condition is assumed to be NULL, so the query returns the total home_goals scored by Liverpool in each season.

You can also use the AVG function with CASE in two key ways. 

First, you can calculate an average of data. You can do this using CASE in the EXACT same way you used the SUM function. Just change out SUM for AVG in this query, and you instead get the AVG goals Liverpool scored in each season.

You can make the results easier to read using ROUND. ROUND takes 2 arguments -- a numerical value, and the number of decimal points to round the value to.

Place it outside your aggregate CASE statement, and include the number of decimal points at the end.

There, that's much easier to read!

The second key application of CASE with AVG is in the calculation of percentages. This requires a specific structure in order for your calculation to be accurate.

The question we're answering here is, ""What percentage of Liverpool's games did they win in each season?""

The first component of this CASE statement is a WHEN clause identifying what you're calculating a percentage of -- in this case, how many games did they win? This is tested in the same way as previous slides, and your THEN clause returns a 1. 

The second component identifies Liverpool's games that they LOST, and returns the value 0. All other matches -- ties, games not involving Liverpool -- are excluded as NULLs.

Here are the results of this query ...

... and here's the ROUNDed, more readable version of the results.

Now it's your turn to practice creating CASE statements with aggregate functions.

sql Tricky developer interview questions for 2+ years experience Operators

In a SQL developer interview for candidates with 2+ years of experience, operators play a pivotal role. Candidates may be asked to articulate how they utilize various operators such as arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators to manipulate data effectively. Emphasis might be placed on understanding operator precedence, their impact on query performance, and how they're applied in complex queries to filter, aggregate, or join data. Demonstrating a nuanced understanding of operators showcases a candidate's ability to craft efficient and precise SQL queries, reflecting their proficiency in database manipulation.

SQL interview questions range from basic queries to complex scenarios. For entry-level positions, expect questions about basic CRUD operations and joining tables.

AK7_m-aThfw,Top 25 SQL Interview Questions and Answers(The BEST SQL Interview Questions),"In this video, I will share my Top 25 SQL Interview Questions and Answers which I have captured from my own experience of using SQL for the past 12 years. Learn these SQL Questions and also all the SQL concepts which are covered in these 25 questions to clear any SQL Interview.

In this video, I will go through my pick for the top 25 SQL interview questions and then provide some additional information on what the interviewer is expecting from you when he asks these questions. The answers to each of these 25 SQL questions are present in my blog. I have written a blog in my website techTFQ where I have mentioned these 25 questions along with the answers to these 25 questions.

In this video, I will go through the questions but will not explain all the answers in detail. You can find all the answers in my blog.

11:43 SQL Interview Questions (#11 to #15)
16:52 SQL Interview Questions (#16 to #20)
22:14 SQL Interview Questions (#21 to #25)

One of the most challenging part of preparing for an SQL interview is to identify what the SQL concepts we need to learn to clear the interview. Hence in this video, I wanted to share from my experience what were the top SQL questions for clearing Interview. I have come up with these questions after taking several SQL interviews myself and also by giving several SQL interviews over the past 12 years of the work experience.

These questions are just in my opinion the most important SQL questions or SQL concepts that you need to prepare before an SQL interview.
These questions are not in any specific order and the questions are scattered for a beginner or fresher SQL developer to intermediate SQL position to a Senior level SQL position. 

I hope the video and my blog would benefit you guys to clear SQL interview.
I'd be more than happy to know about your interview success stories. DO share them in the comments below if this video and my blog helped in any way.

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

Q1) What is SQL?
Answer: SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It’s used to communicate with and manage data in a relational database.

Q2) What is a subquery in SQL?
Answer: A subquery is a query nested inside another query to retrieve data used by the outer query.

Answer: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It cannot be null or duplicated.

Q4) What is a foreign key?
Answer: A foreign key is a field in one table that links to the primary key in another table, creating a relationship between the two.

Q5) What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?
Answer: WHERE filters rows before grouping; HAVING filters groups after aggregation.

Q6) What is a JOIN in SQL?
Answer: A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

Q7) What is normalization?
Answer: Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

Let's be honest, I dove into SQL thinking it was this mythical beast that only coding wizards could tame. But guess what? It turned out to be a superpower anyone can unlock – and believe me, This SQL Roadmap is FREAKING VALUABLE!

Now, the big question: how long does it take to learn?

The truth is, it depends on your background and goals. Here's a roadmap to get you started:

• SQL Basics (1-2 weeks): Grasp the core concepts like creating tables, querying data, and using filters. This is your foundation!

• Intermediate SQL (2-4 weeks): Dive deeper into joins, functions, and data manipulation. Here's where the magic starts to happen!
• 
• Advanced SQL (Varies): Master window functions, stored procedures, and complex queries. This is where you become a data rockstar!
Remember, this is just a general guide. The key is to practice consistently. Here is the road map that I used for learn SQL. 
Basic (2-3 Weeks):

• Fundamentals: 
o Introduction to Databases and SQL
o Data Types (e.g., integer, string, date)
o Understanding Relational Databases (tables, columns, rows)
o The Data Manipulation Language (DML): 
     SELECT statements (retrieving data)
     WHERE clause (filtering data)
     ORDER BY clause (sorting data)
     LIMIT clause (specifying results)

• Working with Data: 
o INSERT statements (adding data)
o UPDATE statements (modifying data)
o DELETE statements (removing data)

Intermediate (2-4 Weeks):
• Building Queries: 
o JOINs (connecting tables): 
     INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN
o Subqueries (queries within queries)
o Filtering with advanced WHERE clauses (operators, functions)
o GROUP BY clause (aggregating data)
o Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
o HAVING clause (filtering grouped data)

• Data Management: 
o Creating and altering tables
o Data types and constraints
o Working with Views (virtual tables)

Advanced :

This video will teach you all the fundamentals of data analysis in just 10 minutes. First, we'll go over how to transform or clean up a raw set of data on Excel. This will include using features like the trim formula, data types, removing duplicates, and more. Then, we'll look at descriptive statistics using the data analysis feature on Excel. This will give us important numbers like the average, min, max, quartiles etc. We'll also create a box and whisker chart for analysing outliers. Third, we'll analyze the data using pivot tables. Finally, we'll create a small report using conditional formatting, xlookups, sumifs and more.

In this tutorial using a real-world dataset on the Olympics, we go over the 4 core steps of data analysis in excel. First, we clean up the data. For this, we create a backup of the raw dataset, remove duplicates, and more. Then, we transform the data. This includes replacing certain values, filling in the blanks, and using the TRIM and PROPER functions to clean up. Third, we do the analysis with Pivot Tables and functions, where our manager is asking us a series of questions. Finally, we visualize the data with charts and pivot table slicers.

RPYbfRgYfvk,How to Pull Data into Excel Reports from Another Spreadsheet with VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP,"How to pull a column of data into an Excel report from another spreadsheet using VLOOKUP and then XLOOKUP functions. Extract data from one workbook to another. You'll learn how to apply the VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP functions to your data extraction tasks. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced Excel user, this video will help you save time and reduce errors in your work. Let's compare VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP.

So, which function should you use? It really depends on your specific situation, your level of comfort in Excel, and the complexity of the task you need to accomplish. VLOOKUP is a great function for finding related information in large tables or when you want to add a column of data to a report, which is what we are going to do in this tutorial. 

Syntax for VLOOKUP:
=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])

Now, VLOOKUP does have its limitations. For example, it only works to the right of the lookup value, so you can't use it to look up values to the left of the lookup column. Additionally, VLOOKUP can only search for exact matches or approximate matches based on the closest value, which can be problematic if you have duplicate values.

XLOOKUP is a more powerful function than VLOOKUP that allows you to search for values in any direction (left, right, up, or down) and also supports fuzzy matches and wildcards.

Syntax for XLOOKUP:
=XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode])

Here are the major topics covered:

00:00 1. What does Vlookup function do and how does it work?
03:26 2. How to write a simple Vlookup formula?
07:54 3. The two main causes of errors with Vlookup.

🆓 DOWNLOAD Free Excel file for this video: https://view.flodesk.com/pages/64ba5da925947528293900a5

In this tutorial we go over 5 advanced excel formulas. The first function is the TEXTSPLIT, where we use several delimiters to split columns of data. Second, we go over the SUM and OFFSET combination using a nested formula to make a dynamic sum range. Third, we learn how to use the XLOOKUP with the wildcard feature to detect inconsistent data. Fourth, we use the INDEX MATCH with the ampersand (&) to use multiple criteria to lookup values. Finally, we learn the SUM FILTER combination which is most useful to sum ranges with duplicate filters.

The IF Function is probably the most important function you can learn in Excel. So in this video, I've put together 5 examples of how to use it from easy to hard. First, we'll start with a simple IF statement with greater than as the logical test. Then, we'll learn the IFS formula. Third, we'll learn to combine formulas such as the IF AND. Fourth, we'll look at other formulas that use IF such as the SUMIFS or the COUNTIFS. Finally, we'll look at using the wildcard with the SUMIFS formula. After this IF function tutorial on Excel, you should be able to apply the IF formula to any work setting.

aLV4Qe60VK4,Learn Power BI | Go from Data to Dashboard in 15 Minutes (full tutorial + project files included),"Microsoft Power BI is the #1 business intelligence tool on the planet.

Whether you’re a data professional or just getting started, Power BI can help you work faster, make smarter decisions, and significantly increase your earning potential.

And the best part? ANYONE can start learning Power BI in just a matter of minutes – for free!

In this demo, we’ll play the role of a Data Analyst for the Federal Aviation Administration 🛩️

We’ve been given access to a database containing nearly 2,000,000 commercial flights from major US airports, and our task is to use that data to understand which flights were delayed or canceled, and why.

Using Power BI, we’ll transform the raw data into a user-friendly, interactive dashboard to help stakeholders drill into flight delays and cancellations by airport, airline, day of week, and more.

Along the way, we’ll walk through each step of the business intelligence workflow:

✔️ Load and transform the raw data

✔️ Build a relational data model

✔️ Add calculated columns & DAX measures

✔️ Design a stunning, interactive dashboard

…all in less than 20 minutes!

QpMIibQnsDc,Create dashboards in Power BI,"Unlike Power BI reports, dashboards offer a distinctive, personalized view. With dashboards, users can build a tailored artifact that directs attention to the specific data they care about. They achieve this by allowing you to pin visuals from different reports into one cohesive snapshot. In contrast to reports—which pull data from one unified semantic model—dashboards provide the flexibility to draw on insights from multiple models, offering a dynamic and comprehensive perspective on your data.

The Secret Formula to Nail 'Tell Me About Yourself'
What’s the best way to answer: ‘Tell me about yourself’ in an FP&A interview? Master this one answer, and you won’t just survive interviews. You’ll steer them
Most FP&A candidates blow up the start of the interview when asked, “Tell me about yourself.” It’s not because they lack experience—it’s because they havent prepared well or they just don’t see the real purpose behind this question. Research shows first impressions happen fast, and this opening sets the tone for everything that follows. 
In this video, I’ll show you the exact three-part formula—Present, Past, Future—that hiring managers hope you’ll use. 
But before we get into how to answer, let’s look at what’s really going on when interviewers ask this question.
Here are different ways interviewers may ask the “Tell me about yourself” question in an FP&A interview:
“Walk me through your background.”
“Can you give us a quick overview of your career so far?”
“Why don’t you start by introducing yourself?”
“What makes you a good fit for this position?”
“Give me a summary of your professional journey.”
Interviewers want to know one thing: Can you translate your experience and skills into something that their FP&A team needs?
Your title doesn’t need to say “FP&A” for you to be the right fit. They don’t want your job history—they want your value story. 
All of these can be answered using the same Present–Past–Future framework—just adapt the tone based on how open-ended or casual the phrasing is.
Ready? Let’s start with how to frame your current role.
To stand out in FP&A interviews, you need to make the “Present” part of your answer count.
Your current role is your launchpad. Don’t just list tasks—highlight results.
 Instead of saying, “I prepare reports,” say:
 “I analyze monthly variances so leadership can adjust budgets in real time.”
That one shift tells them: You get it.
Quantify your impact.
 ✅ “Reduced month-end close time by 30% by automating reports.”
 ✅ “Identified 5% savings by analyzing spend patterns.”
Even if your title isn’t “FP&A,” your work might already align. Do you:
Build dashboards?
Track KPIs? Support forecasting?
Then frame it like this:
 “I used Power BI dashboards to help sales teams visualize performance gaps—leading to a 10% improvement in conversion rates.” Stick to one or two crisp examples.  The Past: Mining Experience for FP&A Gold
Let’s look at your past—because even if your previous roles weren’t in FP&A, they likely built the right skills.
Did you analyze trends, cut costs, or improve processes? That’s FP&A in action. For example: “In my accounting role, I spotted a recurring error during close and fixed it—boosting accuracy by 20%.”
Focus on one story. Use the STAR method to highlight a real business impact. Show that you weren’t just doing tasks—you were thinking critically and driving results.
S – Situation, T – Task, A – Action, R – Result

You’ve shown how your past built the foundation—now it’s time to show how you’ll use that foundation to drive results in the future.
This part isn’t about what you hope to learn—it’s about how you’ll solve their problems from day one. To do that, start by studying the job description and company updates. Are they rolling out a new planning tool? Expanding globally? Trying to improve forecast accuracy?
Let them know you’re ready to hit the ground running. For example: “I saw you're implementing a new planning system.",2025-06-25T13:45:14Z,7.98,167,12,"Power BI, Interview, BI Tools"

What's my story? An engineer, in love with his job, started teaching on the side. Got lucky. Impacted 1000s of lives. Had to finally leave his job to increase the impact surface area. Raised $5M funding to fix education. Is learning day and day about startups and building a valuable product. 

How is it going? A decade of engineering helps in systems thinking and product building. Learning about Strategy, Marketing, People Management, and Finance on the go. 

What am I building? Today, 25 million Indians prepare for government job entrance exams. They do it for years together. The probability of success is less than 1% but they still do it. Why? For the lack of a structured alternative to launch their white-collar career. I am building Invact to bridge this gap.

9tnEOZfa8_I,Master Calculated Fields in Tableau: A Beginner's Guide | Itvedant,"Calculated fields in Tableau are a powerful feature that allows users to create new data points by applying formulas and expressions to existing fields. They are commonly used to perform mathematical calculations, manipulate text, create conditional logic, and transform data for better analysis.

📞 Contact: Call us on 9205004404

With calculated fields, you can generate custom metrics that aren't directly available in your dataset. For example, you can calculate profit margins, categorize data based on conditions, or create dynamic date-based filters. They also enable the use of advanced functions, including string manipulation (LEFT, RIGHT, MID), date calculations (DATEDIFF, TODAY), and logical expressions (IF, THEN, ELSEIF, CASE).

These fields can be classified as row-level calculations, which are computed for each data row, and aggregate calculations, which summarize data across multiple rows. They enhance dashboards by providing more personalized insights and allowing for complex analytical scenarios.

Understanding calculated fields is essential for creating advanced Tableau dashboards that deliver in-depth, actionable insights.

r-uOLxNrNk8,"Data Analysis with Python - Full Course for Beginners (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)","Learn Data Analysis with Python in this comprehensive tutorial for beginners, with exercises included!
NOTE: Check description for updated Notebook links.

Data Analysis has been around for a long time, but up until a few years ago, it was practiced using closed, expensive and limited tools like Excel or Tableau. Python, SQL and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In this tutorial you'll learn the whole process of Data Analysis: reading data from multiple sources (CSVs, SQL, Excel, etc), processing them using NumPy and Pandas, visualize them using Matplotlib and Seaborn and clean and process it to create reports.
Additionally, we've included a thorough Jupyter Notebook tutorial, and a quick Python reference to refresh your programming skills.

Let me know if you have any questions!

In this video we walk through many of the fundamental concepts to use the Python Pandas Data Science Library. We start off by installing pandas and loading in an example csv. We then look at different ways to read the data. Read a column, rows, specific cell, etc. Also ways to read data based on conditioning. We then move into some more advanced ways to sort & filter data. We look at making conditional changes to our data. We also start doing aggregate stats using the groupby function. We finished the video talking about how you would work with a very large dataset (many gigabytes)

I realized as I upload this video there are some additional things I want to talk about in a later video. The first thing that comes to mind immediately is using the apply() function on a dataframe to alter the data using a custom or lambda function. If you have questions on this or anything else before I get around to making  a part 2, feel free to write me a note in the comments.

What is Python?
Python is a high-level object-oriented programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in 1989 and was first released in 1991. Python is often called a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. A fun fact about Python is that The name Python was actually taken from the popular BBC comedy show of that time, Monty Python's Flying Circus. Python is widely used these days from data analytics, machine learning, and web development. Python allows you to write programs in fewer lines of code than most of the programming languages. Python as a programming language is growing rapidly. It's the right time to get trained in Python.

Following are the standard or built-in data type of Python: 
1. Numeric data types
2. Text data type
3. Sequence data type
4. Mapping data type
5. Set data type
6. Boolean data type
7. Binary data type

4QzjAUfZeYo,Data Cleaning In Python Pandas (Beginners Data Analyst Tutorial),"Data Cleaning In Python Pandas (Beginners Data Analyst Tutorial)

Course Files here: https://github.com/edgecate/Data-Analyst-Pandas-Tutorial

In this video, you'll learn the basics of a Python library I used a lot in my data projects to do ETL, data cleansing, and report automation.

It’s called Pandas and it’s like a smarter, musclier, and cuter version of Excel VBA and SQL. You can use Pandas to query data like you would with SQL, and you can use it for data cleansing and data analysis like you would in Excel and VBA like doing Sorts, Filters, Remove Duplicates, and Formulas.

It’s an amazing tool to learn, and this video is a quick crash course on the basics of Pandas where you’ll learn the following:
0:00 Intro
1:47 Install Python
2:57 Install Our Code Editor (Jupyter Notebook) 
3:18 Install Pandas
3:28 Launch & Use The Code Editor
6:24 Import Data
10:19 Add new columns
11:29 Convert data types
13:07 Sort data
14:38 Remove duplicates
16:33 Joins
19:12 Replace values
20:11 Use If statements
23:29 Export our data to CSV
25:15 Outtro

The dataset we’ll be using for this crash course is this made up driver license data - one is the contact details of a driver in a CSV file, and the other is their license details in another CSV file.

As a data analyst, the data cleaning and ETL requirements you’ve been given are to: 
-Add a column for Full Name - so that’s concatenating First & Last Name
-Remove the Time from Birthdate - so it only has the date only without zeroes
-Join the Driver & License Files using a Left Join
-Replace the 1 & 2 values in Test Passed with No & Yes
-Determine if a License Status is Valid if Test Passed is Yes & Points is less than 12
-And then split & export the data into 2 CSV files - 1 with Valid statuses only, and the other with Invalid statuses.",2023-05-14T12:03:07Z,25.53,848,26,"SQL, Excel, Python, Portfolio"

jXpyB_C0If0,How to learn Python for Data Analysis,"Learning Python for data feels like drinking from a fire-hose, right? You open Google, type “best Python resources,” and a 10-mile scroll of tutorials, frameworks, and buzzwords spills out.

Breathe. You don’t need 99 % of it to land your first analyst gig.

This carousel breaks down the only five libraries I teach my boot-camp students when the goal is “get hired ASAP.”

1️⃣ Pandas – Excel on steroids. Read a CSV, clean up the mess, join tables, spit out insights.

2️⃣ NumPy – The math engine under the hood. If Pandas is the fancy restaurant, NumPy is the kitchen where the slicing & dicing happens fast.

3️⃣ Matplotlib – The blank canvas. Basic lines, bars, histograms—ugly by default, but it never says “no” to a custom plot.

4️⃣ Seaborn – The interior decorator. Built on Matplotlib, but adds instant style: heatmaps, violin plots, correlation matrices in 1–2 lines.

5️⃣ Scikit-Learn – The machine brain. Load your cleaned data, split train/test, and call .fit() to spin up models from logistic regression to random forests.

How to use this roadmap
Pick ONE messy dataset that excites you (Kaggle, your Fitbit logs, company sales export—whatever).

Yay finally posting again. Hopefully this video will help you get comfortable working through the matplotlib library. I'm going to post a follow up video with real-world examples (combining pandas with matplotlib) and different types of plots next week. I originally was going to include that in this one, but I thought the video was getting a bit too long.

In this video we walk through some of the basics of matplotlib. We start by making a simple line graph. We learn how to give the graph a title and label the x & y axis. We learn how to scale the graph by specifying the x & y tickmarks. After this, we restyle our line by passing in keyword arguments then do basically the same thing with a shorthand notation. We resize our graph and save it. Then we end with a simple bar chart. 

Source Code (includes code and data for next video as well):

https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html

Font List:

Install libraries Needed for this video:
Option 1:
Open up a terminal window and type
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install pandas

Option 2:
Download anaconda which will contain all the packages we need. A video on how to do this is here: https://youtu.be/YJC6ldI3hWk

This Python matplotlib tutorial will help you understand what is matplotlib, types of plots, plotting graphics and subgraphs, adding a graph inside a graph, graph parameters, line graphs, canvas grid & axis range, 2D plots, radar charts, histogram, 3D surface image along with a practice example. Data visualization is the technique to present the data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables stakeholders and decision makers to analyze data visually. Many new python data visualization libraries are introduced recently, such as matplotlib, Vispy, bokeh, Seaborn, pygal, folium, and networkx. The matplotlib has emerged as the main data visualization library. The data in a graphical format allows them to identify new trends and patterns easily. Matplotlib is a python two-dimensional plotting library for data visualization and creating interactive graphics or plots. Using pythons matplotlib, data visualization of large and complex data becomes easy. Now, let us get started and understand matplolib and how it can be used.


The below topics are explained in this Matplotlib tutorial:
1. What is matplotlib? (00:55)
2. Types of plots (01:25)
3. Plotting graphics and subgraphs 
4. Adding a graph inside a graph
5. Graph parameters - title, label, legend
6. Line graphs - line types, color and transparency
7. Canvas grid and axis range
8. 2D plots - scatter, step, bar, fill_between
9. Radar chart, histogram, the contour image
10. 3D surface image
11. Practice example (pie chart)

Matplotlib is one of the most popular Python packages used for data visualization. It is a cross-platform library for making 2D plots from data in arrays. Matplotlib is written in Python and makes use of NumPy, the numerical mathematics extension of Python. In today’s video, we will be discussing Matplotlib using various examples.

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, PyQt, or GTK+.  It can be used in Python and IPython shells, Jupyter notebook, and web application servers also.

Data Visualization makes our work so easy and makes such abundant data so simplified and easy to understand and work upon. Matplotlib does the same for us and it makes it easier to draw insights from abundant data and work accordingly on it. Want to know more about this interesting topic?

What Happened when I started learning Python For Data Analysis At that time I had no plane or path for Learning. 

so here I have to share with you how you can start your journey for Data Analysis with Python. 
Because Python is very important when We talk about Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Data science. 


You can categorize these Pandas functions into different groups based on their purpose in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1️⃣ Basic Data Exploration

▫️df.head() – View the first few rows

▫️df.tail() – View the last few rows

▫️df.shape – Get number of rows and columns

▫️df.size – Get total number of elements

▫️df.info() – Get summary of DataFrame


2️⃣ Data Summary & Missing Values

▫️df.describe() – Get statistical summary

▫️df.isnull().sum() – Count missing values

▫️df.isnull().sum()/df.shape[0] – Percentage of missing values


3️⃣ Indexing & Selection

🔹df.iloc[0], df.iloc[0]['Name'] – Access by position

🔹df.loc['a'], df.loc['a']['Name'] – Access by label

🔹df.loc['a', 'Name'] – Select specific value


4️⃣ Iteration & Transformation

▫️df.iterrows() – Iterate over rows

▫️df.itertuples() – Iterate as named tuples

▫️df['col'].apply() – Apply function to column

▫️df['col'].str.upper() – Convert string column to uppercase

▫️df['col'].map() – Map function to column


5️⃣ Data Manipulation

🔹df['new'] = df['old'] + 2 – Create a new column

🔹df.rename() – Rename columns

🔹df.reset_index() – Reset index


6️⃣ Date & Time Handling

🔸pd.to_datetime() – Convert to datetime

🔸pd.Timedelta() – Time differences


7️⃣ Handling Missing Data

🔸df.fillna() – Fill missing values

🔸df.dropna() – Remove missing values


8️⃣ Reshaping & Aggregation

🔺df.drop() – Drop rows/columns

🔺df.melt() – Unpivot DataFrame

🔺df.pivot() – Pivot DataFrame

🔺pd.pivot_table() – Create pivot table

6GUZXDef2U0,Seaborn Tutorial : Seaborn Full Course,"New Data Science / Machine Learning Video Everyday at 1 PM EST!!! [ Click Notification Bell ]

This video provides complete coverage of Seaborn with many real world examples. Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. Seaborn is often used because it makes attractive visualizations and works easily with Pandas and NumPy.

While with Matplotlib you often have to write multiple lines of code to create a plot, Seaborn makes assumptions on what you want which often translates into getting the same plot with 1 line of code.

If you want a video that condenses the whole Seaborn API and all that it can do into 1 video with a ton of examples, then this video is for you.

I cover most everything you'll learn by reading the API here. Next I'll cover SciPy, StatsModels, Plotly, Cufflinks, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scrapy, Linear Algebra, Calculus and more. CLICK THE NOTIFICATION BELL

Descriptive Statistics: This branch focuses on summarizing and describing the features of a dataset through measures such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation, as well as through graphs and charts. It aims to provide a clear overview of the data without making inferences about a larger population.

Inferential Statistics: This branch uses samples of data to make generalizations or predictions about a larger population. It includes hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and analysis of variance. Inferential statistics allows researchers to draw conclusions beyond the immediate data, estimating population parameters and testing hypotheses.

kyjlxsLW1Is,Teach me STATISTICS in half an hour! Seriously.,"THE CHALLENGE: ""teach me statistics in half an hour with no mathematical formula""

The RESULT: an intuitive overview of distributions, sampling and hypothesis testing that (almost) scrapes in under 30 minutes :) 

Whether you're studying statistics for the first time or are just curious as to what the study of statistics is all about, this video is a great introduction to several core concepts.

Oh, and all the examples I use come from the 2018-19 NBA season.

Steph's 3 point percentage is what is called a 'ratio', which is numeric. It can be argued to be discrete (as for a given number of attempts, there are only so many possible percentages that can be achieved), or continuous (if we allow the number of attempts to change). Heated arguments either way here are semantic, in my opinion :)

In the previous version we suggested that the terms “odds” and “probability” could be used interchangeably.  While this may be okay in casual conversation (since both have to do with the likelihood of an event), the two terms mean something slightly different in math and are calculated differently.  We apologize for any confusion.",2019-05-16T03:16:52Z,11.47,4093013,60534,Statistics
b9a27XN_6tg,Probability: Types of Distributions,"👉🏻 Sign up for Our Complete Data Science Training with 57% OFF: https://bit.ly/31QAkMi

In this lecture we are going to talk about various types of probability distributions and what kind of events they can be used to describe. Certain distributions share features, so we group them into types. Some, like rolling a die or picking a card, have a finite number of outcomes. They follow discrete distributions. Others, like recording time and distance in track & field, have infinitely many outcomes. They follow continuous distributions.

Video Timestamps: 

1:29 Discrete Distributions
3:42 Continuous Distributions

 We are going to examine the characteristics of some of the most common distributions. For each one we will focus on an important aspect of it or when it is used. Before we get into the specifics, you need to know the proper notation we implement when defining distributions. We start off by writing down the variable name for our set of values, followed by the “tilde” sign. This is superseded by a capital letter depicting the type of the distribution and some characteristics of the dataset in parenthesis. The characteristics are usually, mean and variance but they may vary depending on the type of the distribution. Alright! Let us start by talking about the discrete
ones. We will get an overview of them and then we will devote a separate lecture to each one. So, we looked at problems relating to drawing cards from a deck or flipping a coin. Both examples show events where all outcomes are equally likely. Such outcomes are called equiprobable and
these sorts of events follow a discrete Uniform Distribution. Then there are events with only two possible outcomes – true or false. They follow a Bernoulli Distribution, regardless of whether one outcome is more likely to occur. Any event with two outcomes can be transformed into a Bernoulli event. We simply assign one of them to be “true” and the other one to be “false”. Imagine we are required to elect a captain for our college sports team. The team consists of 7 native students and
3 international students. We assign the captain being domestic to be “true” and the captain being an international as “false”. Since the outcome can now only be “true” or “false”, we have a Bernoulli distribution. Now, if we carry out a similar experiment several times in a row we are dealing with 
a Binomial Distribution.

Probability and statistics on Khan Academy: We dare you to go through a day in which you never consider or use probability. Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!

ANMuuq502rE,R programming for beginners – statistic with R (t-test and linear regression) and dplyr and ggplot,"R programming for beginners -  This video is an introduction to R programming. I have another channel dedicated to R teaching: https://www.youtube.com/c/rprogramming101 In this video I provide a tutorial on some statistical analysis (specifically using the t-test and linear regression). I also demonstrate how to use dplyr and ggplot to do data manipulation and data visualisation. Its R programming for beginners really and is filled with graphics, quantitative analysis and some explanations as to how statistics work. If you’re a statistician, into data science or perhaps someone learning bio-stats and thinking about learning to use R for quantitative analysis, then you’ll find this video useful. Importantly, R is free. If you learn R programming you’ll have it for life.

A hypothesis is an assumption or conjecture about a relationship. 
For example, your hypothesis might be:
Men earn more than women in Germany.
Our goal now is to test this hypothesis. 
So we want to know whether to reject or retain the hypothesis.

But what is it about null and alternative hypotheses?
Two hypotheses are always formulated, that assert the opposite.
These are called the null and alternative hypotheses.

w_NWNYxLH04,Driving AI Transformation How To Lead A Successful Copilot Rollout,"Empowering the Next Generation of Work with AI

The modern workplace is reaching a critical inflection point. According to Microsoft’s 2025 Work Trend Index, 80% of the global workforce reports not having enough time or energy to do their jobs, and 53% of leaders say productivity must increase. As workloads intensify, the demands on IT organizations to deliver more efficient, secure, and scalable solutions have never been higher.

Microsoft 365 Copilot is designed to help organizations navigate this complexity. Far beyond a basic chatbot or AI integration, Copilot acts as an intelligent assistant embedded within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. It offers enterprise-ready features that blend productivity, security, and extensibility—tailored to support the most demanding business environments.

In our recent webinar, we explored Copilot’s full value proposition, shared implementation guidance, and reviewed a compelling real-world case study. Below is a summary of the most important insights shared, along with guidance for IT leaders considering their Copilot journey.

What Sets Microsoft 365 Copilot Apart

Microsoft 365 Copilot is not a standalone tool. It is fully integrated into the applications your teams already use every day—Word, Excel, Teams, Outlook, PowerPoint, and more. This deep integration delivers a seamless experience where users can interact with AI directly inside familiar workflows.

Here are the key differentiators highlighted during the session:

Personalized AI-first productivity: Copilot connects to users’ work and web data to deliver context-aware responses and suggestions.

Built-in AI agents: Advanced agents such as the Analyst and Researcher act like digital employees, supporting complex tasks like data modeling, summarization, and strategic research.

Copilot Studio: Organizations can extend Copilot using pre-built or custom-built agents through Copilot Studio, empowering IT departments to create domain-specific solutions.

AI-powered search: With 80+ data connectors, Copilot offers lightning-fast access to distributed enterprise information using natural language search.

Governance-first design: Copilot integrates into the Microsoft 365 Control System, offering visibility, reporting, and administrative controls that consumer-grade AI tools lack.",2025-06-23T22:05:00Z,50.25,20,0,"Excel, Portfolio"

http://instagram.com/lillian__chiu

One of the most common questions I get asked is ""what skills do I need to become a business analyst?"" Back in 2019, I started my career as the youngest business analyst at Spotify (since I started right out of college). As glitzy as that sounds, this was also the period in my life when I experienced the most crippling case of imposter syndrome;  Self-doubt became my reality and quite frankly, I felt 'less than' my peers at work. This video compiles the three key skills I wish I had known when I first started out on my Business Analyst journey. Whether you're a new grad looking to start a career as a BA or someone who’s looking to transition into a BA role, I know that the first time trying something new can seem scary, but the one guarantee in life is that nothing stays “first” forever. To those of you thinking of embarking on your BA journey, I'm cheering for you! More [career chat] vids to come, lmk what topics you want me to ~deep dive~ into. -Lillian

When I first started as a business analyst at spotify in 2015, every time when I had to do an analysis I’d always jump straight into the data, trying to find patterns and insights in hopes to provide business solutions quickly. However, I would always get drowned in data and the insights would be all over the place. It’s important to pause and plan out your thinking & approach for a problem structurally, and only after that should you use data to validate your thinking.🤓 video is on my channel!",2023-07-20T13:36:21Z,0.57,72324,3756,"Interview, Portfolio"

zBSbaSkuYjY,Supply Chain Analysis with VBA Automation 94 Case Study Automating Data Engineering,"Hi Everyone !

#DataEngineering #SupplyChain #ExcelVBA #DataTransformation #Automation #BusinessIntelligence #StructuredData #DataProcessing #WorkflowOptimization
🔎 Problem Statement
#RawDataIssues #DataInconsistency #ReportingErrors #DataPreparation
In supply chain and logistics, data comes from multiple sources, including ERP systems, supplier reports, customer orders, and warehouse logs. However, this data is often scattered, unstructured, and inconsistent, leading to:

1️⃣ Data spread across multiple sheets/files, making consolidation difficult.
2️⃣ Inconsistent formats, with numeric, text, and date values mixed incorrectly.
3️⃣ Duplicate records, which cause miscalculations in inventory and demand planning.
4️⃣ Missing or incorrect values, leading to errors in forecasting.
5️⃣ Lack of key business metrics, like lead time and stock turnover, which are crucial for decision-making.
6️⃣ Difficulties in integrating data with BI tools like Power BI, SQL databases, or ERP systems.

🚨 Why is this a problem?
❌ Inaccurate demand planning due to missing or duplicate records.
❌ Delayed decision-making caused by messy, unstructured data.
❌ Manual data cleaning is time-consuming and error-prone.
❌ Reporting errors in dashboards due to incorrect formats.

🎯 Proposed Solution
#ExcelAutomation #DataEngineeringPipeline #SmartDataProcessing #BusinessIntelligence
To solve these issues, we created a VBA macro that automates data engineering by:

✅ Merging data from multiple sheets into a single structured dataset.
✅ Computing new fields such as lead time (delivery minus order date) and stock turnover ratio.
✅ Standardizing formats for dates, numbers, and text to ensure consistency.
✅ Removing duplicate records to maintain data accuracy.
✅ Filtering irrelevant records based on supply chain business rules.
✅ Automatically formatting and aligning data for easy integration with Power BI, SQL databases, or Excel reports.

🚀 Why this VBA solution?
✔ Automates manual tasks, saving hours of data processing time.
✔ Ensures clean, structured, and analysis-ready data for dashboards and reports.
✔ Enhances data accuracy, eliminating errors caused by inconsistent formats.
✔ Prepares data for advanced analytics, machine learning, or forecasting models.

🛠️ How the VBA Script Works
#DataTransformation #VBAForBusiness #DataPipeline #SmartAutomation
The VBA macro follows a 7-step process to engineer and clean data:

1️⃣ Extract and merge raw data from multiple worksheets into a centralized dataset.
2️⃣ Compute lead time (Delivery Date - Order Date) to analyze supplier performance.
3️⃣ Calculate stock turnover ratio to measure inventory efficiency.
4️⃣ Standardize warehouse and supplier names by converting them to uppercase.
5️⃣ Convert numbers, dates, and text fields into the correct format.
6️⃣ Remove duplicates based on Order ID and SKU Code to ensure accuracy.
7️⃣ Auto-fit columns and finalize the dataset for reporting and analysis.

📊 Example Use Cases
#BIIntegration #DataPreprocessing #IndustryApplications
✅ Automating Data Pipelines – Preparing structured data for Power BI dashboards.
✅ ERP Data Cleaning – Formatting supply chain data before importing into SAP, Oracle, or Microsoft Dynamics.
✅ Warehouse Efficiency Analysis – Generating lead time insights to evaluate supplier reliability.
✅ Demand Forecasting Models – Preparing clean, structured datasets for machine learning models.

📌 Final Benefits
#WorkflowAutomation #DataQuality #ErrorPrevention #VBAForBusiness
🚀 Transforms unstructured raw data into structured, analysis-ready datasets.
🚀 Reduces human error and eliminates the need for manual data preparation.
🚀 Saves time by automating repetitive tasks in Excel.
🚀 Ensures accuracy and consistency for forecasting, reporting, and analytics.",2025-06-25T15:00:06Z,4.07,68,1,"SQL, Excel, Power BI, Portfolio, BI Tools"

2b04QncJL8I,Smartsheet Tutorial for Project Managers (WITH Reports and Dashboards),"This comprehensive Smartsheet tutorial will teach you how to use Smartsheet as a project manager, no matter if you’re a beginner or a pro. Start with a single project and work your way up to multiple projects, with reports, dashboards, and automations (workflows) to tie them all together.
🚀 Get started with Smartsheet for free at https://bit.ly/trysmartsheet

Here’s what you’ll learn:
First, you’ll get familiar with Smartsheet’s main editor: the smart spreadsheet! Manage tasks and subtasks and learn how to organize and customize columns (contact list, dates, etc.).

Then, you’ll explore the Gantt view, including Smartsheet’s advanced dependency tracking (Predecessors), and how to set project milestones and baselines.

Next, you’ll learn how you can use cell and column formulas specific to project management to speed up calculations for your sheets.

Then, you’ll learn how to use Conditional Formatting to call attention to different parts of your sheet automatically.

Next, you’ll explore team collaboration–through comments and conversation, file attachments, and proof reviews.

Then it’s time to learn about workflows, to automate common tasks so you spend less time doing busy work. Examples include notifying members when they have tasks assigned and automatically requesting status updates before your weekly review.

That ends the single project track. Then stick around to learn how to roll-up multiple sheets into reports.

Finally, this walkthrough ends with turning your reports into visual dashboards you can use to get a bird’s-eye view of multiple projects.

🔍 Project Highlights:
• Used ggplot2 for visualizing biological measurements  
• Applied color and shape aesthetics mapped to penguin species  
• Used facet_wrap to create subplots for each species  
• Added a clean theme and plot labels for clarity

W-7IrLp2U5Y,"What Is Data Storytelling? Definition, Why It's Important & Tips!","What is data storytelling, and what does ""telling a story with your data"" even mean? It's a simple concept but sounds a bit complex. 

Data storytelling is the art of using data visualizations to craft a narrative that triggers emotion and drives action. It turns raw data into a compelling story, making it more engaging and resonant with the audience.

While data visualization represents the graphical representation of information, data storytelling goes a step further. Think of data visualization as an illustration in a children's book that helps illuminate the scene. In contrast, data storytelling is the narrative as a whole, using visualizations to enhance the story, trigger emotions, and drive the audience to take action. It's a more comprehensive approach that combines visual elements with a compelling narrative.

It will significantly benefit the data analysis process as well as the results from that analysis.  Exploring your mindset and getting to place of neutrality and purpose while working can help clear the mind to do a more thorough and complete study.  Look at the big picture and the small; understand the bias and the purpose.   Data analytics is as much an art as it is a science.  Anyone with any background can be curious and investigate information to tell a complete story.

Data storytelling in action: https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/feature/Data-driven-storytelling-opens-analytics-to-all

Data storytelling is like data visualization, in that it makes hard facts and numbers more accessible to non-data experts. But, data storytelling adds the context and meaning that data visualization sometimes lacks. 

Data storytelling takes data at the end of an analytics pipeline and automatically generates a written explanation of the data -- in sentence form -- that almost anyone can understand. The concept of data storytelling isn’t new -- we tell data stories every day without even noticing it. But, data storytelling as a technology is still emerging, and experts anticipate it can revolutionize analytics.

jizZKNnx9wA,7 Effective Tips for Presenting Data at Work!,"Apparently you lose all credibility by using Pie Charts 🥧, so in this video, I share 7 Data Storytelling Tips to Improve Your Presentations to colleagues, managers, and senior leadership!

One of the most important skills to build in the workplace is to present data in an effective way. Data by itself is useless, it's how you interpret and how you present that data that will separate you from your peers. Data Visualization often means creating graphs and charts that tell a compelling story - a story that captures the audience's attention and makes them want to take action.

One of my favorite data storytelling tips is to use color purposeful to highlight one or two important elements in your slide. Our brains are wired to recognize patterns so colors are great to focusing our audience's attention. Furthermore, waterfall charts (waterfall graphs) are amazing at showing how two numbers relate to one another. This type of graph is used by many consulting firms (most notably by McKinsey Consultants). 

Comparison graphs are also great at bringing the data to life: What would happen if Option B happened instead of Option B? And can we put a number to the difference?

▶ What is Data Storytelling?
The idea behind data storytelling is to create an engaging tale using intricate data and analytics to influence and inform a specific audience.

 ▶ The benefits of data storytelling
While human narrative is quite similar to data storytelling, the latter has the advantages of deeper insights and supporting data via graphs and charts. Through data storytelling, complex information is made understandable so that your audience will be more engaged and able to make important decisions more quickly and with greater assurance.
💡Adding value to your data and insights.
💡Interpreting complex information and highlighting essential key points for the audience.
💡Providing a human touch to your data.
💡Offering value to your audience and industry.
💡Building credibility as an industry and topic thought leader.

▶ Using data visualization to enhance your data storytelling
How open your audience is to hear difficult information depends in large part on the data visualization you use. Data visualization aids in the simplification and digestion of vast volumes of data. Here, you can add the images required to bolster your narrative. Successful data visualizations can aid in:
💡Reveal patterns, trends, and findings from an unbiased viewpoint.
💡Provide context, interpret results, and articulate insights.
💡Streamline data so your audience can process information.
💡Improve audience engagement.

▶ The three key elements of data storytelling
Together, data storytelling and data visualization use a disciplined methodology to convey your findings through three key components: narrative, graphics, and data. To produce a well-rounded example of your theory and the actions you want people to do as a result, it's crucial to mix the three components below as you write your data story.
1. Build your narrative
2. Build your narrative
3. Show data to support
